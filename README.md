# First Perl Program

#### My first published repo in the Perl programming language.

#### By _Kevin Williams_

## Technologies Used

* _[Perl](https://www.perl.org)_

## Description

Welcome to my first published project in [learning Perl](https://learn.perl.org/first_steps).

I started it on Saturday July 2nd 2022. It is designed to be run from
the command line, with no substantial user interface. Contrary to the
instructions linked above, I chose to not use the ```.pl``` file
extension for the app itself.
